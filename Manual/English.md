Office Tool Plus is a small tool for managing Office deployments.
It is based on Microsoft's Office Deployment Tool.
If you want to know more detail on how to deploy Office, you may proceed to Microsoft official [Office Deployment Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/deployoffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool) page. Microsoft has detailed explaination on deployments of Office software.

Office Tool Lite is a tiny tool to deploy Office.
It has no dependency on third party softwares.
In Enterprise environment and Unversity environment where you need to deploy large amounts of Office installations, this is the right tool for you.
Using Office Tool Lite, is similar to using Office Tool Plus, but 'Lite' contains its unique features.

Office Tool requires .Net Framework 4.6.1 or above.
If you cannot launch Office Tool on Windows 7, please try to download and install .Net Framework with [online installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=780597) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=780601).

By default, Office Tool will try to request for administrative privilege even if you're running it using a non-administrator user.
If you refuse to give administrative privilege to Office Tool, you can still do some basic operations such as downloading Office or view some information.
