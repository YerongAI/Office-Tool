## Application Legitimacy

Office Tool Plus is based on Microsoft's [Office Deployment Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-the-office-customization-tool-for-click-to-run). And we added some functions according to the needs of users.

### About Activate Function

The activate function was based on Microsoft's ospp.vbs (Office Software Protect Platform), all activate operations are performed by ospp.vbs. And in order to let users better understand OSPP, we translated it (zh-cn, zh-tw).

You can view the description of OSPP in ````"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.HTM"```` (Office installed required).
