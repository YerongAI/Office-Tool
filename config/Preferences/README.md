This information is collected from [Office Customization Tool](https://config.office.com/), **I don't recommend anyone changing it.**

Some text is translated by machine and therefore may contain grammatical errors.

Note:

1. Microsoft does not provide versions for Arabic, Indonesian, Polish, Romanian and Thai, so the English version is used by default.
2. We will check this from time to time and will update it immediately if there are any changes.
3. If you think some of the texts needs to be updated, you can submit your update and we will deploy the update on our server immediately.
